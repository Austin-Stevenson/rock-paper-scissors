# rock-paper-scissors

Build a game of rock, paper, scissors using vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.

My version of the game is modelled after one of my favourite childhood games. Runescape. In this game, you must defeat the oncoming horde by using your knowledge of the combat triangle. However, your opponent knows about the triangle too. Can you defeat the hordes and return Zamorak back to the underworld?

Melee beats Ranged.
Magic beats Melee.
Ranged beats Magic.
